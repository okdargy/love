As of February 27th, List of Values: Everlast will be **ceasing operations**.

<h2 className="font-bold text-xl">Why are we ceasing operations?</h2>

We have made the decision to cease operations because the Polytoria economy has been stagnant for a while, with trading becoming increasingly rare (less than 1 trade per day on average). At this point, it's no longer feasible to continue updating values.

<h2 className="font-bold text-xl">What does this mean for the future of LOVE?</h2>

The polytoria.trade website will continue to be hosted, and the deals bot will remain active and new items will continue to appear on the polytoria.trade website though with a notice that certain identifiers will no longer be updated.
- ❌ **Value, Demand, Trend, Fun Fact, Tags, Shorthand**
- ✅ **Owners, Hoard Rate, Trade History, Best Price graph**

Essentially, anything that is automated will continue to work but features that require manual processing won't be updated.

<h2 className="font-bold text-xl">Will LOVE ever come back?</h2>

Who knows? If Polytoria trading suddenly takes off, we might reconsider our decision.

<h2 className="font-bold text-xl">Thanks to:</h2>
