As of March 11th, 2025, List of Values: Everlast will be **ceasing operations**.

## Why are we ceasing operations?

We have made the decision to cease operations because the Polytoria economy has been stagnant for a while with some weeks having less than 1 trade per day on average. After realizing the state of the trading community, we've come to the decision that it is no longer feasible to continue updating values.

## What does this mean for the future of LOVE?

The polytoria.trade website will continue to be hosted, and the deals bot will remain active and new items will continue to appear on the polytoria.trade website though with a notice that certain identifiers will no longer be updated.
- ❌ **Value, Demand, Trend, Fun Fact, Tags, Shorthand**
- ✅ **Owners, Hoard Rate, Trade History, Graphs**

Essentially, anything that is automated will continue to work but features that require manual processing won't be updated.

## Will LOVE ever come back?

Who knows? If Polytoria trading suddenly takes off, we might reconsider our decision.
